The ingredients below make enough to serve six people as a side. Multiply up as appropriate.

This goes brilliantly in a taco or burrito, with chilli, or, if you're starving, it's also pretty good on toast.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 a red onion
- 2-3 tomatoes (depending on size)
- Small bunch coriander
- Salt
- Juice and zest of half a lime

That's the versatile base. To this, you can add:

- A single red chilli (or more, one tends to be about right though)
- 1/8 red cabbage (+ more lime juice)

Or for a summery twist (perhaps for a barbecue)

- Half a mango

## Directions

Finely chop all the ingredients - aim for a 3-4mm dice of the onion, a little larger for the tomatoes and the cabbage, if you're using it.

A note on the coriander: you'll want to include some of the stem as well, chopped finely (1-2mm). If you've got it from the supermarket, take the base of the stems off, then chop upwards from there.

Mix, add the lime, and a pinch of salt.

### Credits

Lost to history - I first made salsa to go with some calamari with my Dad when I was 12, and this recipe isn't far off that.
