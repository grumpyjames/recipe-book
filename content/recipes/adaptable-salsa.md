The ingredients below make enough to serve six people as a side. Multiply up as appropriate.

This goes brilliantly in a taco or burrito, with chilli, or, if you're starving, it's also pretty good on toast.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 a red onion
- 2-3 tomatoes (depending on size)
- Small bunch coriander
- Salt
- Juice and zest of half a lime

That's the versatile base. To this, you can add:

- 1/8 red cabbage (+ more lime juice)
- A single red chilli (or more)

Or for a summery twist (perhaps for a barbecue)

- Half a mango

## Directions

Finely chop all the ingredients - aim for a 3-4mm dice of the onion, a little larger for the tomatoes and the cabbage, if you're using it.

A note on the coriander: you'll want to include some of them stem as well; here you want to give extremely fine. If you've got it from the supermarket, take the base of the stems off, then chop upwards from there.

Mix, add the lime, and a pinch of salt.

### Credits

Lost to history - I first made salsa to go with some calamari with my Dad when I was 12, and this recipe isn't far off that.
