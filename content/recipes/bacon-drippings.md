## Ingredients

- Bacon rashers (as many as you need)

## Equipment

large skillet; tongs; plate; paper towel; jar.

## Directions

Heat a large skillet (ideally a cast iron pan) on medium-low heat. Lay out rashers of raw bacon and let them cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes, flipping them occasionally. When the bacon has browned and crisped to your taste, use tongs to lift the rashers out of the pan and place them on a sheet of paper towel or two on a plate.

Pour the fat in the pan into a jar. Allow the fat to cool and then keep the jar in the fridge. The drippings will solidify to a creamy substance.

You can strain out any solid bacon bits before pouring the fat into a jar, if you wish to extend the life of the fat. These bits can give flavour, so you may want to leave them in if you think you’ll use the drippings within a few months. If you don't filter out the solid bits, the fat can last a couple of months in the refrigerator. If you do filter out the solid bits, it will last longer.

Exposure to light and oxygen will accelerate a fat going rancid, which is why it's best to store bacon drippings in the fridge. If you want to store the drippings beyond a few months, you can also freeze them.

When you cook bacon again, pull out the jar and add more pan fat to it.


Bacon grease can replace butter, oil or other fats in recipes. It has a low smoke point, so it's not good for high-heat cooking, but it is great for roasting, moderate sauteing, and baking.

When cooking with bacon fat, spoon it out from the jar. Usually half a teaspoon is all that is needed to give a flavour boost to whatever you’re making.

Some uses for bacon drippings: refried beans; brussels sprouts with bacon; scrambled eggs; Staffordshire oatcakes.

A note on disposing of droppings: don’t pour hot bacon grease down the drain or into the bin; allow it to cool and solidify and then clean the pan with a paper towel and throw it away. If your drippings have been in their jar for too long and smell bad, scoop them into the bin rather than pouring them down the sink, clogging your plumbing. Animal fats cannot normally be composted, but check with local schemes to be sure.
