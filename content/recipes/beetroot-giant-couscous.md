## Ingredients

- 2-3 raw beetroot (320g), peeled and chopped 
  - If you can get a mixture of standard + golden, all the better.
- 3 red onions (320g), cut into wedges
- 2 green or orange peppers, deseeded and cubed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 320g cherry tomatoes 
  - Similarly, if you can get an array of heritage colours, go for it
- 200g wholewheat giant couscous
- One pack of feta (200g) (optional, unvegan)

For the pesto

- 7g fresh coriander, roughly chopped
- 15g flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 green chilli, deseeded
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 40g pine nuts, lightly toasted

## Equipment

Teaspoon; tablespoon; chopping board; sharp knife; roasting tray

## Directions

Heat the oven to 200ºC/180ºC fan/gas 6/400ºF.

In a bowl, toss the chopped beetroot, onions and peppers together with the oil, then spread out on a large roasting tray lined with baking paper and roast for 35 mins. Scatter over the cherry tomatoes, then return to the oven for 10 mins more until the tomatoes have softened and the vegetables are tender.

Meanwhile, cook the couscous following pack instructions, then rinse and drain.

To make the pesto, put the coriander and half the parsley in a bowl with the garlic, chilli, cumin, vinegar, oil and 25g of the pine nuts. Add 2 tbsp water, then blitz with a hand blender until smooth or use a small food processor.

Toss the roasted veg and chopped parsley through the couscous and pile on the pesto, then scatter with the remaining pine nuts (and crumbled feta, should you so wish).
