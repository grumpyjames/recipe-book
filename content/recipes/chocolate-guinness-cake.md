## Ingredients

- 250ml Guinness
- 250g unsalted butter
- 75g cocoa powder
- 400g caster sugar
- 150ml sour cream
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 275g plain flour
- 2½ teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
- 300g cream cheese
- 150g icing sugar
- 2 teaspoons cornflour
- 125ml double cream (or whipping cream)

## Equipment

## Directions

Heat the oven to gas mark 4/180°C/160°C Fan/350ºF

Butter and line a 23cm/9 inch springform tin.

Pour the Guinness into a large wide saucepan. Add the butter — in spoons or slices — and heat until the butter has melted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cocoa and sugar.

Beat together the sour cream, eggs and vanilla and then stir into the pan. Whisk the flour and bicarb into the pan.

Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined tin and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the sponge bounces back when lightly pressed and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.

Once baked, leave the cake to cool completely in the tin on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake.

When the cake's cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand, to ice.

Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sieve over the icing sugar and cornflour and then beat to combine. If using double cream, add it and beat until you have a spreadable consistency. If using whipping cream, whisk first to soft peaks, add a couple of spoonfuls into the cream cheese mixture and once this is combined, fold in the rest.

Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint.
