_Serves: 8 *very* hungry people_

## Ingredients 

- 500g puy lentils
- 2 onions
- 4-5 celery stalks
- 2-3 big carrots
- 4 or 5 garlic cloves
- 2 cans of chopped tomatoes
- 2 beef and 1 vegetable stock cube (or all veg)
- 2 tablespoons tomato purée (add more for more sweetness/redness)
- 100-250ml crème fraîche (cream works too, but use less, mascarpone also works well. Dairy alternatives untested but available)
- A large glass of cheap red wine
- Some olive oil
- Your own bolognese additions, e.g.: generous tabasco; basil; herbes de Provence; oregano; chilli powder; maybe a finger chilli or two; splash of Worcestershire sauce; whatever herbs you have in the cupboard and fancy in your bol
- Pasta of your choosing
- Cheese (cheddar or parmesan. Dairy alternatives, as above)
- Black pepper, for seasoning once plated.

## Equipment

Measuring scales; pyrex measuring jug; medium pan (if using); small bowl; large bowl; teaspoon; whisk; large frying pan; ladle; fish slice/flipper; plate.

### Important quantities note

Some rules of thumb: you want roughly the same amount of carrot, celery and onion by volume; and, their total volume should roughly match that of the lentils (possibly a little more; the veg will shrink, the lentils will grow).

## Directions

Dice the onion, carrot and celery. The dice should be small (< 5mm), or you'll get unpleasantly crunchy vegetables. Peel/crush the garlic while you're there. Stick all of that in a pan with some olive oil and fry, gently until soft. This takes much longer than most cookery books tell you (probably twenty minutes).

While that's happening, boil a kettle, and get the lentils going in a separate pan (most lentils come with cooking instructions; follow them). Once they're simmering, chuck one of the stock cubes in with them and give it a stir. Leave the lentils simmering in the background (e.t.a 25-40 minutes).

The vegetable mix should now be softening and potentially even sticking to the pan. Use some red wine to deglaze the pan/unstick the veg, and add your two remaining stock cubes. Once the wine's starting to boil away, add the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée and your own bolognese additions. Once that gets back to a simmer, add your dairy (alternative) and leave the mix simmering (not boiling, you'll curdle the dairy and it'll be a total disaster).

Now your lentils might be ready. When ready, blitz half of the lentils into a purée (a stick blender is easiest) and leave half as lentils. This is where you get the meaty texture that mince would otherwise provide. Thanks for the pro tip, Nigel Slater. Add the blitzed and whole lentils to your vegetable/tomato mixture, and keep it on the heat until it gets to a consistency you like. Add more tomato puree/herbs to taste.

Now's a good time to put your pasta on, and grate some cheese. The rest is up to you.
