Serves 8 folks easily.

## Ingredients

* ~800g of chunky white fish. 
  Seriously, the species doesn't matter a lot.
* 2 limes
* 1 onion
* 1 carrot
* 1 red bell pepper
* 6 garlic cloves
* Chilli peppers of your choosing 
  
One or two reasonable spicy red ones would be our recommendation

* 4 or 5 tomatoes
* 2-3 tablespoons tomato purée
* Paprika
* Ground cumin
* 2 fish stock cubes
* 1 can coconut milk (do not under any circumstances buy a low fat one, much of the flavour's from here)
* Decent sized bunch of coriander (75g+)

You can use parsley at a push, but seriously, coriander and coconut are meant to be together.

Optional sides

* Head of broccoli
* Crusty bread (excellent for dipping)
* Rice

## Equipment

Zester, juicer, slicer, dicer, one big stewpot and something to stir it with.

## Method

Cut the fish into 3-4cm pieces. Pop the pieces in a bowl. Zest and juice one of the limes. Add that to the bowl. Sprinkle over a generous amount of salt and paprika in addition. Move the fish around in the bowl so that all the pieces get a reasonable coating. N.B You can do this the night before and let it marinate in the fridge overnight, if you're that sort of person. We never are.

Chop up the onion, carrot, pepper, tomatoes (all ~5mm dice), garlic (crush mercilessly, or finely dice) and chilli peppers (thin roundels, so the colour doesn't get lost). Fry them in a pan with some olive oil. Start with the onions and garlic, adding the carrot, pepper and chilli peppers subsequently, and the tomato only when the carrot looks like it's starting to soften. Once that's simmering, add the zest/juice of the other lime, the tomato purée, the stock cubes and a generous helping of paprika/cumin (at least a teaspoon of each).

Once that's simmering, you can add the coconut milk. Once you've got _that_ up to temperature, it's time to add the fish. The goal here is to get the fish down towards the cooking surface of the pan:

1. Manoeuvre the existing solids in the stew over to one side. 
2. Place as much fish as you can on the free side. 
3. Cover the fish with the vegetables leaving the other side clear again.
4. Place the remaining fish there. 
5. Spread vegetables evenly over the new rapidly cooking fish.

If you're planning to serve this with rice, now's the time to start cooking that - the fish will be ready in around ten minutes.

It's also time to chop up that coriander; finely at the stem end, and more roughly towards the leaves. Add that to the pot, stir.

Serve.
