## Ingredients

- 118ml cider vinegar
- 236ml water
- 1 tablespoon of maple syrup, honey or any sugar you have available
- 1 ½ teaspoons of sea salt
- 1 red onion

## Directions

Add vinegar, water, sugar and salt to a jar, close the lid and shake until sugar and salt have dissolved.

Slice the onion into thin slivers and add it to the jar. Give the jar a shake with the lid on to ensure the onion is covered by the liquid.

Let the mixture sit for an hour with the lid off. Use a fork to remove the onions from the liquid. Eat.

Refrigerate onions in the liquid for up to two weeks.

Add these pickled onions to salads, like this sweet potato and feta one, or tacos, like our slow cooker carnitas tacos or Baja style fish tacos.
