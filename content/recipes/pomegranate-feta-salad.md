## Ingredients

- 65g cup pecans
- 85g granulated sugar
- 10oz/283g pack mixed baby greens
- 1 pomegranate, peeled and seeds separated
- Â¼ red onion, sliced thin
- 8oz/226g pack feta cheese

Dressing

- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon white sugar or honey
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- salt and pepper to taste

## Equipment

It is a mystery.

## Directions

To make the candied pecans, pour the sugar in a small skillet and pour the pecans on top. Cook over medium heat until sugar melts and turns a caramel colour, stirring constantly so that the nuts and sugar do not burn. Be patient! It takes a while for the sugar to start melting. Once the sugar turns a caramel colour, keep stirring to coat the pecans with it. Pour pecans onto greased wax paper or foil to cool. Once the pecans are cooled, break them into pieces.

Place the lettuce, pomegranate seeds, red onion, feta cheese, and pecan pieces into a large mixing bowl; set aside.

Add the Dijon mustard, vinegar, olive oil, sugar or honey, lemon zest, lemon juice (to taste), salt, and pepper to a jar. Pop the lid on and shake. Pour over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
