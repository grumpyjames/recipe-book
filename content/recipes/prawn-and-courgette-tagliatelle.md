Serves 4

## Ingredients

* ~250g of big prawns
* 2 lemons
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 decent sized courgettes
* 1 red chilli (or more)
* 50g parsley
* 250g tagliatelle
* 4 tablespoons olive oil (minimum)

To season (optional):

* Parmesan
* Black Pepper
* Chilli Oil (recommended)

## Equipment

Zester, juicer, garlic crusher, grater, one pot for the pasta, and another for everything else. Stirring equipment.

## Method

First: remove any possible prawn casing - they'll be easier to eat.

Grate the two courgettes coarsely. Pop them in a pan with the olive oil, and fry over a medium heat.

Boil the kettle and get the tagliatelle on in the other pan.

Peel and crush the garlic cloves, add to the courgette.

Finely chop the chilli into roundels, add that to the courgette and garlic mixture.

The courgette should start to brown after 5-10 minutes - it should be squishy but not falling apart. Zest and juice the two lemons while you wait.

At this point you can add the prawns to the courgette pan; they should take no more than a couple of minutes to cook.

Finely chop the parsley, then add it and the lemon to the pan.

Drain the pasta, then add the contents of the two pans together.

Dress with chili oil, black pepper and parmesan to taste.
