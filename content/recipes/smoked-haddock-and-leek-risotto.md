## Ingredients

- 2 leeks
- 2 celery sticks
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 bay leaves (fresh preferred, but dried fine too)
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 glass of white wine
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 200g risotto rice
- 600ml chicken or vegetable stock
- A pint of milk
- 400g of smoked, undyed haddock
- 4 rashers of streaky bacon or 125g lardons (optional)
- A few threads of saffron, if you have them
- Greens for four, such as, collard, savoy or tender cabbage, brussels sprouts, or spinach
- Sprinkle of parmesan and ½ a lemon (both optional)

## Equipment

Chopping board; sharp knife; measuring jug; heavy-bottomed pan; wooden spoon; colander; roasting tray; foil; ladle; fish slice/flipper; grater.

## Directions

Turn the oven on to 170°C/330°F.

Chop leeks: holding a leek at the root end, cut about an inch from the end and slice all the way up through the green. Rotate the leek round by 90 degrees and repeat, until you have four flapping leek quarters. Starting at the green end, slice crossways at centimetre intervals. Repeat for the other leek. Put leek bits in a colander.

Pop the heavy-bottomed pan, that you’ll be using for the risotto, on the hob to warm.

Chop celery: slice celery in half lengthways - where the celery is wider at the base, consider chopping again so that you have sticks that are all similar in width. As with the leeks, chop the celery sticks crossways at centimetre intervals, so the sticks fall into small chunks. Add the celery chunks to the colander of leek bits. Give leeks and celery a good wash under cold running water and shake to dry.

Add the olive oil to the pan and turn up high. Once the oil is hot, add the shaken leeks and celery and stir with a wooden spoon.

If using, add lardons or chop bacon crossways at centimetre intervals and add to pan. Give mix a good stir, taking care to avoid crisping by reducing temperature if needed - aim for gold.

Remove skin from garlic cloves, sprinkle some salt on the garlic, flatten and grind with the side of the knife and then chop finely. Add garlic to pan, turning the heat down to medium (if you haven’t already) and give everything another good stir.

Fill the kettle with at least 600ml and set to boil, for your stock.

Haddock prep: check for bones in haddock fillet by carefully running a finger along it and removing any found. Choose your roasting tray, pour a pint of milk into it and add the haddock. Add the bay leaves and some saffron (saffron varies a lot in quality - you can be pretty generous with the cheap stuff and stingier with the good stuff). Cover tightly with foil. Put on the top shelf of the heated oven.

Give the veg mix another stir and consider turning low - the mix should be soft but not crispy. Add seasoning, if you like. Use your boiled kettle to prepare the stock.

You are about to whack the heat right up, so that you can add your risotto rice, so consider if you need another splash of olive oil or a knob of butter. When ready, put the heat right up and add the rice. For the next 2 minutes, keep the rice moving in the pan. Add the wine and let it reduce away, stirring all the time. Now start adding the warm stock, a ladleful at time and then resume stirring the rice. When there’s an increase in noise, add your next ladle of stock. Repeat until all of the stock has been added, stirring often.  Once you add the last of the stock, turn the heat down to medium. The risotto should have cooked for around 20 minutes by now and the fish will have been on a little longer, allowing for time spent stirring the veg mix and preparing the stock.  You can make risotto a lot slower if you cook it on a medium rather than high heat, but it depends how quickly you need to cook and eat.

Remove the fish from the oven and then remove the foil. Lift the fillet out using a fish slice and set it to one side on a plate to cool. Also set the milk mix to one side and switch off the oven. Warm shallow bowls for the risotto with the oven door open, if you wish.

Cut any stalky bits out of your greens, pile the leaves up, roll them up into a sausage shape and then slice at 1 centimetre intervals, so you have little rolled shreds. Wash them well, drain and then add to the rice.

Turn the heat down to low and add one and a half ladles of the milk. Give the mix a good stir, so the greens begin to wilt. Move a bay leaf over from the milk to the risotto.

Try the rice to see how it's doing. If it still has quite a bit of bite, increase the temperature again and add another ladle and a half of milk. Keep mixing the rice over the greens, so that the greens wilt some more. Use as much or as little milk as you need - any leftover milk can be turned into chowder later.

The fish should now be cool enough to handle. Flake it into the pot.

Turn the heat off, put a lid on and let the risotto rest for a minute or two whilst you lay the table. Give the risotto a couple of final checks: it should be creamy and not sticky - if yours is gloopy, a splash of milk should restore it; taste for seasoning and add, if needed.

Serve in the shallow bowls with a sprinkle of parmesan or a squeeze of lemon, if you fancy.
