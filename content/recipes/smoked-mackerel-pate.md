## Ingredients

- 3 hot smoked mackerel fillets
- 150g cream cheese
- 100g crème fraîche
- 3 tsp freshly grated horseradish
- Lemon, to squeeze
- Small handful of dill, finely chopped
- Cornichons, to taste

## Equipment

Toaster, mini blender, sharp knife, bread knife, serving plate

## Directions

Skin the mackerel fillets and check for any bones.

Flake three quarters of the mackerel into a food processor with the cheese, crème fraîche and horseradish and whizz until smooth.

Add a good grinding of black pepper, and lemon juice to taste, then fold through the dill and the remaining fish.

Serve with rye bread or crisp wholemeal toast. Spread the pâté, slice the cornichons into roundles or leave whole if you prefer a crunch and top the pâté.

Can be scaled to make generous canapés for around 20 guests, by tripling the quantities. Serve with a choice of two or more other canapés, for variety.
