## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 6-8 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
- Large pinch red pepper flakes
- 60g capers, drained and chopped
- 60g chopped pitted black olives
- 225g whole peeled or chopped tomatoes ('half a can')
- 140g tuna (one can)
- Salt
- 250g dried spaghetti
- Dried Basil or generic "Italian Seasoning"
- 30g Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- Black pepper

## Equipment

One skillet for making the sauce, a pan to do the pasta, a colander.

## Directions

In a medium skillet, combine 4 tablespoons oil, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (It should sizzle, gently, rather than angrily) Add capers and olives and stir to combine.

Once this is feeling well combined - get the pasta on in an alternative pan.

Returning to the sauce; add the tomatoes (squash them a bit so there's a consistent texture), stir to combine, and bring back to that sizzle temperature. Flake in the tuna. Add a decent sprinkle of the italian seasoning / basil and some of the grated cheese (or just leave the cheese for garnishing). If things are looking a bit too solid, add a little more olive oil.

Once the pasta's ready, drain it - depending on the thickness of your sauce, you might want to keep a bit of the pasta water - and then mix the sauce and the pasta together into a delicious, tasty gloop. Serve (and eat) immediately, with the remainder of the cheese and a generous contribution from the pepper grinder.
