Serves: 10 oatcakes
Prep time: xx minutes
Wait time: 1 hour or overnight

## Ingredients

- 450ml milk
- 450ml warm water
- 250g finely ground oats (you can grind 250g ordinary oats in a food processor)
- 100g strong wholemeal flour
- 100g strong white flour
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 4g dry yeast or 10g fresh yeast
- Fat of your choice: lard, bacon drippings, clarified butter, vegetable oil
- Toppings of your choice: cheese, fried egg, smoked bacon

## Equipment

Measuring scales; pyrex measuring jug; medium pan (if using); small bowl; large bowl; teaspoon; whisk; large frying pan; ladle; fish slice/flipper; plate.

## Directions

Heat the milk and water to 98.6℉ (37℃), either in a pan on the stove or in a pyrex jug in the microwave.

Meanwhile, mix the oats, flours and salt in a large bowl.

Mix the yeast with a little of the warm liquid and then cover and leave until frothy. Stir into the dry ingredients and then whisk in the remaining liquid until smooth. Cover and leave in a warm place for about an hour until bubbly, or overnight in the fridge if you prefer.

Grease a large frying pan with a little fat and put on a medium-high heat. When hot enough for the batter to sizzle as it hits it, give the bowl a quick whisk, then add a ladleful to the pan and tilt to spread it out. Cook until dry on top, then loosen the edges and carefully turn it over (depending on the size, it may be easiest to flip it on to a plate or board slightly larger than the pan) then slide it back into the pan. Cook until golden on the bottom, then remove from the pan and stack on a plate. Repeat with the batter until all is used and you have 10 oatcakes.

Add toppings to oatcakes and grill. Roll and eat. 

Alternatively, allow the stack of oatcakes to cool then cover and store in the fridge or freezer. If freezing, thaw before grilling with toppings.

In our family, as well as making a mean breakfast, oatcakes are sometimes wheeled out as a midnight snack at parties.
