## Ingredients

- 113g salmon fillets (optional)
- 2 tablespoons olive or avocado oil
- 170-227g (2 handfuls) salad leaves
- 1 large sweet potato
- Salt and pepper
- 60g pickled red onions
- 60g crumbled feta
- 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds

For the dressing:

- 125ml olive oil
- 60ml apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper

## Equipment

Peeler; sharp knife; chopping board; baking sheet; measuring jug; fish slice/flipper; skillet; plate; salad bowl; teaspoon; tablespoon; small to medium jar.

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C).

Peel and chop the sweet potato into ¼ inch or ½ cm cubes. Spread the sweet potato over a lined baking sheet and coat the chunks in a tablespoon or so of oil and season with salt and pepper. You can add any extra spices you like, such as paprika or cumin. Bake the sweet potato until the chunks brown on the edges, turning them over mid-way through cooking. This could take 20-40 minutes, depending on your oven.

If using, season the salmon with sea salt and ground pepper. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet (a cast iron pan works well) over a medium-high heat. Place salmon in pan, skin side up for about 4 minutes or until the flesh is golden brown. Flip the salmon over and cook for another 4 minutes on the other side.

Follow our pickled red onions recipe to make the pickled red onions.

Make the dressing by adding all the ingredients to a jar, popping the lid on and shaking. 

In a salad bowl, toss the greens with the sweet potato, pickled red onions, crumbled feta and sunflower seeds. Divide between 2 plates and top with salmon, if using, and drizzle with the dressing.
