Serves 4

## Ingredients

* 3 courgettes
* 1 large white onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 red chilli (or dried chilli flakes)
* 1 can of chopped tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon tomato pur√©e
* 1 veggie stock cube
* 4 tablespoons olive oil (minimum)
* 3 teaspoons generic 'italian seasoning'

Serve with crusty bread, or pasta (probably with cheese and black pepper), it's up to you

## Equipment

Knife, chopping board, pan, spoon.

## Method

Super simple, this one.

Dice the onion coarsely (no smaller 5mm). Start frying that with the olive oil.

Dice the garlic, add that.

Dice the chilli, add that (or the dried version).

Dice the courgette (slightly larger than the onion), add that.

Sprinkle over the italian seasoning.

Wait for a while - the courgettes and onion need to reduce and soften - this will take ten minutes or so.

Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato puree and stock cube. Stir.

That's it.
